Shot in 2020 summer, this video still displays the current state of what the Cotentin looks like. Between the infinite waves coming from the Atlantic sea and the calm sea surrounding Tatihou, Cotentin shows different faces. Waking up fishing among the fishermen of Saint-Vaast La Hougue at the sunrise, the day ends at Le Nez de Jobourg with a magical and warming sunset. If the sun is more rare in winter, it makes fields of Cotentin greener and the sea even more blue in summer. This is where I was born. This is where I grew up. Now, this is where I get energy back. This, is Cotentin."
