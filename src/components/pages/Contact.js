  About me
  </div>

  <div className="pitch_text">
  My name is Arnaud DUPUIS. I recently graduated from my engineering school and I am starting my career in Aerospace engineering field. Besides my education, photography has always been a passion and a way to display how you see things and how you feel when you capture the moment. I first began my journey doing astrophotography with a canon DSLR and a Newtonian telescope. I then got a Lumix GX9 that followed me everywhere I went to In the 2022 year. Italy, Marocco, Finland, Estonia, Greece, Canada and the USA. 
Coding this website is the conclusion of my personal project. Itâ€™s the perfect combination of my interest for both photography and programming. I learned basics of reactJS to achieve my goal.
I am now very happy to share my work with you. Thank you for visiting my website!
